and how to build a social safety net while allowing innovations. We
talked about a bunch of different projects and looked at different
systemic risk views from different countries. So the idea was to
understand it from an economic perspective. I don't think we came to any
great conclusions. There's a lot of economic risk, and people don't
really understand it yet. One idea is to have more forums for central
banks and regulators to understand what the technology can do, so that
they can give insights for what the ramifications might be.
