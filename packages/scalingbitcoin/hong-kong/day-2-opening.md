You know exactly what I am going to be saying. Code of Conduct. Code of
Conduct. Code of Conduct. I am going to introduce the program chair,
Neha. Hi everyone. I hope everyone enjoyed day 1. I thought it was quite

We are going to have a few talks happen later. Look out for those. I'd
like to go ahead and introduce our first speaker, Pieter.
